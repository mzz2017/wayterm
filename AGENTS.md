## Architecture Direction

VVTerm uses a **feature-first architecture** for app-owned source code.

Current architecture:
- `App` owns app entry, composition roots, shared root containers, localization preferences, and iOS app-shell navigation.
- `Core/Sync` owns CloudKit sync infrastructure.
- `Core/Security` owns keychain, device identity, and privacy-mode infrastructure.
- `Core/Network` owns shared connectivity monitoring and Cloudflare transport support.
- `Core/UI` owns shared view primitives and presentation helpers reused across features.
- `Core/Terminal` owns shared clipboard, paste, and terminal text/default helpers.
- `Core/Logging` owns shared logging utilities.
- `Core/SSH` owns shared SSH bootstrap, known-hosts, key generation, environment detection, rich-paste support, tmux/mosh runtime helpers, and `SSHClient`.
- `Features/ConnectionViews` owns connection view tab configuration types and state.
- `Features/RemoteFiles` owns remote file browsing, preview, transfer, and SFTP integration.
- `Features/LocalDiscovery` owns discovery-specific code and UI.
- `Features/Servers` owns server/workspace domain models, server management, and server/workspace UI flows.
- `Features/Stats` owns server metrics collection and presentation.
- `Features/Security` owns app lock and biometric authentication flows.
- `Features/Settings` owns settings window presentation and settings screens.
- `Features/Store` owns Pro entitlements, purchases, and upgrade surfaces.
- `Features/Support` owns support/contact UI surfaces.
- `Features/TerminalThemes` owns theme models, validation, storage paths, parsing, and theme management.
- `Features/TerminalAccessories` owns keyboard accessory models, preferences, settings UI, and accessory validation flows.
- `Features/TerminalPresets` owns terminal preset models, persistence, and preset form UI.
- `Features/TerminalSessions` owns terminal session/tab domain models, session/tab managers, tmux prompt coordination, live activity support, and terminal session UI.
- `Features/VoiceInput` owns transcription/audio capture infrastructure, MLX model management, and transcription settings UI.
- `Features/Welcome` owns welcome/onboarding copy and presentation.
- New app code should land in `Features`, `Core`, or `App` based on ownership.
- New work inside a feature should stay inside its `Features/<FeatureName>` subtree and should not reintroduce app-wide bucket folders.

Feature-first shape:
- `Domain`: pure feature types and rules
- `Application`: feature state, orchestration, coordinators, use-case style logic
- `Infrastructure`: transport, persistence, adapters, external integrations
- `UI`: SwiftUI/AppKit/UIKit presentation only

For Files/SFTP specifically:
- no non-view logic under `UI`
- no feature policy inside `SSHClient` beyond low-level transport/session behavior
- use explicit dependency injection at the feature boundary
- do direct cutovers, not compatibility shims

For every feature:
- keep `Domain`, `Application`, `Infrastructure`, and `UI` boundaries intact
- prefer view-owned dependencies to be injected from the app/screen boundary instead of created inside leaf views
- if shared cross-feature primitives are needed, extract them into `Core` instead of creating new app-wide bucket folders

## Refactoring Rules

When doing architectural refactors:
- prioritize structural splits and ownership cleanup over behavior changes
- preserve existing UI, UX, and visual behavior unless the user explicitly asks for a change
- do not bundle redesigns or new features into a refactor
- keep platform parity intact unless a platform-specific bug is being fixed
- if a behavior change is necessary for correctness or safety, keep it minimal and isolated

Safe refactor expectation:
- same screens
- same entry points
- same interactions
- same user-facing flows
- smaller files, clearer boundaries, better ownership

### Superfile Control

- Do not add new superfiles.
- A Swift source file is a superfile when it is over roughly 1200 lines, or when it is over roughly 800 lines and also has multiple responsibilities, non-trivial lifecycle ownership, cross-layer dependencies, or tests that are hard to localize.
- Treat files over roughly 800 lines as design debt signals, not as an automatic mandate for low-value splits. Use line count to trigger ownership review.
- Prioritize splits by risk and responsibility: extract stable owners for lifecycle, persistence, FFI, input routing, state machines, protocol adapters, and parsing before cosmetic line-count reductions.
- Root/composition views should stay small, ideally 200-300 lines, and only wire dependencies, navigation, and top-level presentation state.
- Move feature UI, policy, parsing, lifecycle intent, and state orchestration into the owning `Features/<FeatureName>` or `Core` layer instead of expanding app-shell files.
- Prefer direct structural splits with focused tests over compatibility shims or partial duplicate paths.
- If touching an existing superfile, either reduce it, extract a coherent owned piece with focused behavior or boundary tests, or document why the change cannot reasonably shrink it in the same atomic commit.
- Avoid extracting code that only saves a few lines while creating unclear ownership, broadening access control, or locking implementation details into brittle structure-only tests.

## Commits

- Use **atomic commits**.
- Each commit must represent one coherent change that can be reviewed and reverted independently.
- Do not mix architecture docs, code moves, behavioral fixes, and unrelated cleanup in one commit unless they are inseparable.
- Prefer a sequence such as:
  - architecture/spec update
  - domain extraction
  - application/store extraction
  - infrastructure extraction
  - UI split
  - targeted safety fix
- Before committing, verify the diff matches a single intent.

## Key Components

### Terminal
- Uses **libghostty** (Ghostty terminal emulator) via xcframework
- Metal GPU rendering
- iOS keyboard toolbar with special keys (Esc, Tab, Ctrl, arrows)

### SSH
- **libssh2** + **OpenSSL** for SSH connections
- Auth methods: Password, SSH Key, Key+Passphrase
- Credentials stored in Keychain

### Data Sync
- **CloudKit** for server/workspace sync across devices
- Container: `iCloud.app.vivy.VivyTerm`
- Local fallback via UserDefaults

### Pro Tier (StoreKit 2)
- Free: 1 workspace, 3 servers, 1 tab
- Pro: Unlimited everything
- Products: Monthly ($6.49), Yearly ($24.99), Lifetime ($49.99)

## Build Dependencies

### libghostty
Pre-built xcframework at `Vendor/libghostty/GhosttyKit.xcframework`
Build with: `./scripts/build.sh ghostty`

### libssh2 + OpenSSL
Build with: `./scripts/build.sh ssh`
Output: `Vendor/libssh2/{macos,ios,ios-simulator}/`

## Testing Notes

### Test Quality

- Prefer behavior and boundary tests that protect real invariants over tests that only assert file shape, line count, symbol names, or incidental implementation layout.
- Structure-only tests are allowed only when they guard an explicit architecture rule from this file. Keep them narrow, documented, cheap to update, and named as boundary tests.
- Do not add tests whose only value is making a refactor appear covered. Each new test should make clear what behavior, lifecycle ordering, ownership boundary, or architectural invariant it protects.
- When refactoring, update or remove brittle tests if they no longer protect a meaningful invariant; do not preserve them as compatibility debt.
- Async and lifecycle tests should assert ordering, awaited cleanup, cancellation, retry, or resource ownership behavior instead of merely checking that a method or callback exists.
- If a test primarily enforces architecture, keep assertions close to the rule being protected and avoid coupling to unrelated source layout.

### iOS CLI tests
- For full iOS CLI verification, prefer the repo wrapper. It serializes testing, disables Xcode's debug dylib layout, preboots the target simulator, and retries only simulator preflight launch failures:

```bash
./scripts/test-ios.sh
```

- Pass normal `xcodebuild test` filters after the script name for focused runs:

```bash
./scripts/test-ios.sh \
  -skip-testing:VVTermUITests \
  -only-testing:VVTermTests/<TestClass>
```

- The default destination is `iPhone 17`. Override with `IOS_TEST_DEVICE_NAME` or `IOS_TEST_DESTINATION_ID` when needed.

### iOS simulator tests
- On macOS 26.5.1 / Xcode 26.5, app-hosted iOS unit tests can hang before XCTest output when Xcode's debug dylib layout is enabled (`ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=YES`, the default app-debug layout). The app launches, but the host process has no `XCTestConfigurationFilePath` and no `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=...libXCTestBundleInject...`, so XCTest never injects the test bundle.
- For focused CLI iOS unit tests, use `ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=NO`, disable parallel testing, and skip UI tests:

```bash
xcodebuild test \
  -project VVTerm.xcodeproj \
  -scheme VVTerm \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled NO \
  -skip-testing:VVTermUITests \
  -only-testing:VVTermTests/<TestClass> \
  ENABLE_DEBUG_DYLIB=NO
```

- The shared `VVTerm` scheme includes both `VVTermTests` and `VVTermUITests`; `-skip-testing:VVTermUITests` prevents running UI tests but Xcode may still prepare/build the UI test target. Prefer a unit-test-only scheme or test plan if this becomes disruptive.

## Swift Lifecycle Rules

- For Swift, SwiftUI, iOS, macOS, SSH/resource lifecycle, concurrency, teardown, reconnect, or Apple platform bugfix/review work, use the repo skill `$swift-apple-lifecycle`.
- Before editing Swift or Swift test files, read `docs/engineering/swift-best-practices.md` in the current session and say so in the first work update. After reading it, run `python3 .codex/hooks/swift_lifecycle_guard.py --mark-best-practices-read`; the Codex hook resets this marker at session start and blocks Swift diffs without it.
- SwiftUI `View`, `UIViewRepresentable`, `NSViewRepresentable`, and Coordinator must not be the sole owner of critical long-lived resources.
- UI sends intent; the application layer owns lifecycle, teardown, reconnect, and retry orchestration.
- Lifecycle-critical work such as disconnect, close, save, delete, sync, authentication, and cleanup must be awaited or tracked.
- Avoid untracked `Task {}` and `Task.detached {}` for lifecycle-critical work. If a call site cannot await, store or return a `Task` and make later operations wait on it.
- Non-trivial lifecycles should use explicit states such as `idle`, `connecting`, `connected`, `closing`, `disconnected`, and `failed`; do not infer business lifecycle from SwiftUI view existence.
- Mutable shared state should be actor-isolated or `@MainActor`; keep heavy parsing, crypto, file IO, and network IO off the main actor.
- C/FFI calls must keep pointer lifetimes local, preserve raw error codes in logs, and serialize sensitive paths when thread-safety is uncertain.
- Bug fixes need regression tests when feasible, especially async ordering tests for close/open/reconnect behavior.
- Unit test files must include enough context for future triage: protected behavior, test target/invariant, fake assumptions, and when the test should be updated instead of treated as a regression. Individual tests should have descriptive names plus Given/When/Then comments or equivalent assertion messages.
- Do not claim tests pass unless they ran and completed. If only `build-for-testing` passed or XCTest hung, state that explicitly.

## Data Models

### Server
```swift
struct Server: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var workspaceId: UUID
    var environment: ServerEnvironment
    var name: String
    var host: String
    var port: Int
    var username: String
    var authMethod: AuthMethod
    var keychainCredentialId: String
}
```

### Workspace
```swift
struct Workspace: Identifiable, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var name: String
    var colorHex: String
    var environments: [ServerEnvironment]
    var order: Int
}
```

### ConnectionSession (local only, not synced)
```swift
struct ConnectionSession: Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let serverId: UUID
    var title: String
    var connectionState: ConnectionState
}
```

## UI Patterns

### macOS Layout
- NavigationSplitView with sidebar (workspaces/servers) and detail (terminal)
- Toolbar tabs for multiple connections
- `.windowToolbarStyle(.unified)`

### iOS Layout
- NavigationStack with server list
- Full-screen terminal with keyboard toolbar
- Sheet-based forms

### Liquid Glass (iOS 26+ / macOS 26+)
```swift
// Use adaptive helpers for backwards compatibility
.adaptiveGlass()           // Falls back to .ultraThinMaterial
.adaptiveGlassTint(.green) // For semantic tinting
```

## Important Notes

1. **Never apply glass to terminal content** - only navigation/toolbars
2. **Deduplicate by ID** when syncing from CloudKit
3. **Pro limits enforced in**: `ServerManager.canAddServer`, `canAddWorkspace`, `ConnectionSessionManager.canOpenNewTab`
4. **Keychain credentials** are NOT synced - only server metadata syncs via CloudKit
5. **iOS keyboard toolbar** provides Esc, Tab, Ctrl, arrows, function keys
6. **Voice-to-command** uses MLX Whisper/Parakeet on-device or Apple Speech fallback
